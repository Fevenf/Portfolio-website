                <p>My name is Feven Fenta and I'm originally from Ethiopia. I moved to the US  three years ago<br> 
                    and I have been Working in different industries since then. I worked in retail, insurance,<br>
                     medical equipment manufacturing to mention a few. I recently added an amazing job title<br>
                      to my resume by being a first time mom. I’m currently attending the WIN program to learn<br>
                       how to code. I have  ascertained so much about coding since joining the WIN program.<br>
